Zhihu(知乎) is a Chinese question-and-answer website where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by the community of its users. 

**Project Description**:  
This project scrapes zhihu's user data and following-follower data. The workflow is to give a topic to start with. It will first get top n related answers or questions and get all these users' information. After that, it can scrape for more following/follower's information recursively.


## [adnmb.com](http://adnmb.com)

adnmb(A岛) is a 4-chan/2ch like anonymous forum(anonymous to other users, require registration to post) with heathlier content.
