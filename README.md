## zhihu.com

Zhihu is a Chinese question-and-answer website where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by the community of its users. 

**Project Description**:  
This project scrapes zhihu's user data and following-follower data. The workflow is to give a topic to start with. It will first get top n related answers or questions and get all these users' information. After that, it can scrape for more following/follower's information recursively.
